# XJoy

XJoy allows you to use a pair of Nintendo Joy-Cons as a virtual Xbox 360 controller
on Windows. XJoy is made possible by [ViGEm](https://vigem.org/) and
[hidapi](https://github.com/signal11/hidapi).

## Installation

1. [install the ViGEm Bus Driver](https://docs.vigem.org/#!vigem-bus-driver-installation.md)
2. download the latest zip from the releases page and extract it somewhere permanent like your Documents folder
3. that's it!

## Usage

1. pair each of your Joy-Cons with Windows (hold down the button on the side to put into
   pairing mode, then go to add bluetooth device in Windows)
2. ensure that both Joy-Cons show as "Connected" in your bluetooth devices page
3. run XJoy.exe
4. that's it! start playing games with your Joy-Cons. A virtual xbox controller should
   show up as soon as XJoy.exe starts running (you will hear the USB device inserted sound).
5. to confirm that it is working, try pressing some buttons on your Joy-Cons. You should
   see the names of the buttons currently being pressed printed in the terminal.
6. to exit, press [ENTER] in the terminal window. You can also simply close the window
   however this may not disconnect from the Joy-Cons and the virtual controller properly.

## Support this project
XJoy is a free product that I work on in my free time, so any contributions are greatly appreciated.
